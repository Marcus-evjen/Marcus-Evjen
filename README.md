<h1>Hi, I'm Marcus 👋🏼👨🏼‍💻</h1>
![](Git_banner.png)


I am a passionate developer with experience in web development and an interest in learning and creating new things. I started programming and web development at the age of 14, focusing on HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL. What drew me into the world of development was my first project with a Habbo retro hotel back in 2015. This laid a good foundation for me at an early age. Now I'm working on mastering modern web development and mobile applications. Improving JavaScript skills to master React and modern frameworks, as well as exploring better ways to build intuitive and effective user experiences.
